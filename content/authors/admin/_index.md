<span> Personally, I am interested in the study of cognition in humans 🧠 and machines 🤖. 

This pursuit inspires my <span style="color:#EF8371;">RESEARCH</span> spanning <span style="color:#bbdefb;">reinforcement learning</span>, <span style="color:#bbdefb;">deep learning</span>, <span style="color:#bbdefb;">optimization</span> and <span style="color:#bbdefb;">computational neuroscience</span>.</span>

<!-- I focuses on <span style="color:#bbdefb;">designing algorithms</span> that <span style="color:#bbdefb;">learn</span> from <span style="color:#bbdefb;">trial-and-error</span> <span style="color:#bbdefb;">interactive experience</span> with an <span style="color:#bbdefb;">environment</span> by leveraging <span style="color:#bbdefb;">internal representations</span> to <span style="color:#bbdefb;">plan, act and adapt</span> with efficiency. -->

Primarily, I work with the <span style="color:#bbdefb;"> (lifelong) reinforcement learning </span> problem from an <span style="color:#bbdefb;">optimization/deep-learning</span> viewpoint---which has applications in <span style="color:#bbdefb;">computational neuroscience</span> and understanding of neural processes---using tools and perspectives from <span style="color:#bbdefb;">mathematics</span>, <span style="color:#bbdefb;">statistics</span>, <span style="color:#bbdefb;">dynamical systems</span> and understandings from other <span style="color:#bbdefb;">cognitive sciences</span>.


Currently interested in <span style="color:#EF8371;">QUESTIONS</span> related to...

  * 🤖 <span style="color:#00a8e8;">lifelong learning in  AI agents</span> via acceleration, adaptivity, plasticity, planning

    * theoretical and/or empirical 

  * 🧠 <span style="color:#00a8e8;">neuroscience</span> of habitual or goal directed behavior, neuroplasticity

    * psychedelic research for therapeutic drug design ⚗️ 
      * for psychopathologies associated with cognitive inflexibility

    * study and understanding of altered states of consciousness 👁️ 
      * via meditation 🧘🏼‍♀️ breathwork 🌬️ and/or psychedelics 🌀

_________________________________________________________________

Fan of <span style="color:#bbdefb;">research mysteries</span> 🔮 and <span style="color:#bbdefb;">fundamental questions 🦄</span>

Appreciate research that offers a <span style="color:#bbdefb;">new understanding 💡</span> <span style="color:#bbdefb;">insight</span> ✨ or <span style="color:#bbdefb;">connection 🕸️ </span> across branches of research or fields in <span style="color:#bbdefb;">a unifying truth</span> 🤯
