> 🧑🏻‍🎓 I am a Ph.D student in the Reasoning and Learning Lab at McGill University and Mila, Montreal, supervised by <a href="https://cs.mcgill.ca/~dprecup/">Doina Precup</a>. 
_________________________________________________________________
🧑‍🔬 Broadly, my research focuses on designing algorithms 👾 that learn from trial-and-error interactive experience with an environment by building internal representations, which they can leverage to plan, act and adapt with efficiency.

Primarily work with the reinforcement learning problem, but use tools and perspectives from optimization, dynamical systems and understandings from cognitive science.

❔Interested in questions related to
* *AI* 🤖---acceleration, adaptivity, plasticity and planning for lifelong learning
* *neuroscience* 🧠---psychedelic research for neuroplasticity, psychopathology, study and understanding altered states of consciousness induced by meditation 🧘🏻‍♀️ and psychedelics 🌀.
