<!-- I‚Äôm a Ph.D. student in the Reasoning and Learning Lab at McGill University and Mila, Montreal, supervised by Doina Precup. Before that, I completed my M.Sc and B.Sc in Computer Science at University Politehnica in Bucharest, Romania.  -->
<!-- I've also been very fortunate to learn from and research with wonderful people from DeepMind, during the two internships with them.  -->

My research focuses on designing principled reinforcement learning algorithms that can learn fast from trial-and-error  interactive experience with an environment, by building internal representations, which they can leverage to plan, act and adapt with efficiency.

I appreciate research on offers a new understanding, an insight, or connections between seemingly disparate branches of research in a unifying truth. I am also a fan of research mysteries, and tend to get excited by fundamental questions. 

I work with on the reinforcement learning problem, but I use tools and perspectives from optimization, and understandings from cognitive science.

I am currently interested in questions related to learning, adaptivity, planning.
