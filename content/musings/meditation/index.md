To meditate is to observe. The process generally refers to noticing the illusory nature of phenomena---understanding that all phenomena (self or other) are empty, devoid of inherent, absolute existence. What this means is that human beings are actually processes. We become moment by moment. Everything in our lives can only be described as transformation, only in relation, in comparison, or in the context of something else. 

From this it is derived that nothing really "exists", even our sense of identity, or selfhood, is constantly storylined. Therefore, it can be argued that seeking any sort of stability and comfort from identification with this moving constallation of phenomena is madness. However, freedom and stability are available at any moment, as soon as we identify not with the moving contents of the mind, but with the ground space in which this movement of experience is occuring. 

The secret of meditation? Equanimity, i.e. being conscious of every moment of existence and open to whatever comes. 

Resting in awareness, we are in the unchanging here and now. In other words, we break the habit of selecting and organising and explaining experience, and gradually clarity emerges, that "my experience", or "these experiences that arise for, or as me", do not define me.

What is flexible can be shaped. What is open can be free. What is spacious can be everything.
This open awareness offers inexpressible freedom, freedom from existence and non-existence, freedom from separate identity, freedom as simple presence. Without blocking whatever arises, each arising---thoughts, feelings, memories---goes free by itself. 
The nature of the practice is to grow confident that, like all impermanent phenomena, thoughts and feelings arise, exist for some time, and fade away. 

Awareness lights our every thought and feeling, allowing us to recognize them, notice their emergence, duration, and dissolution, without judging or evaluating, welcoming or banishing them.
Thoughts and feelings liberate themselves. There is nothing we need to do, or can do, for that matter. Illuminated, they change, merging, becoming connected, with the observing mind, with consciousness itself, the open ground of all experience.

Noticing again and again this sense of openness, that is the practice, and seeing that whatever occurs is always already inseparable from openness. If the arrising phenomenon is an "inner" thought, feeling, memory or as seemingly "outer" object makes no difference, since in essence we can only interact with the world through our own model of the world, our own interface with the real physical world, never to be trully "known".

Sometimes we may become restless and the restlessness will not reside.
Then we find stillness, follow the breath, smile, and shine awareness on the restlessness, without judgment or resistance, because the restlessness is oneself. All our thoughts and feelings are us. 
Relax, release, trust, open.

To pay attention is to love. What does that mean? It means "amor fati", love all experience, without seeking the good and rejecting the bad. Each thought and action in the presence of awareness is equally sacred, and any dualistic boundary between the sacred and the profane dissolves.

Metta or lovin-kindness is the active practice of radiating good wishes, of feeling radical compassion and empathetic joy for ourselves and others. If love the active practice, it requires the notion of being a lover in love with the universe. 

"Munay" is a word that comes from the Quechua language, mainly spoken in the Andes region of South America. In Quechua, "munay" is used to refer to love, but with a deeper and more holistic meaning.

"Munay" is a type of love that goes beyond the romantic sphere and relates to unconditional love, deep connection with others, and harmony with the world around us. It encompasses respect, compassion, empathy, and self-acceptance, both for oneself and others. It also implies being in balance and harmony with nature and the universe.

The concept of "munay" is closely tied to the Andean worldview and the way of life of indigenous communities in the Andes. It is believed that "munay" is a vital force that flows through all things, connecting human beings to the earth, animals, plants, and the cosmos as a whole.

Munay, metta, loving-kindness represents a compassionate, holistic, and spiritual love that transcends individual relationships and encompasses the interconnection of all things in the universe.
